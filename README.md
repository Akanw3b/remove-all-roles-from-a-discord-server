# remove-all-roles-from-a-discord-server
remove all roles from a discord server
To use this script, you will need to create a Discord bot and add it to your server. You can follow the Discord.py documentation for more information on how to do this.

Once you have the bot set up, you can run the script and use the "!removeroles" command to remove all roles from the server. Please be aware that this action cannot be undone and may cause significant disruption to the server. Use with caution.
